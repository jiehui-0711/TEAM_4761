The tissue block 11941749 All (Home Depot) and MLPA kit ME011-B2 were used for this analysis.  Methylation of the MLHl gene promoter was detected at the C (53%) and D (51%) region.  This result is consistent with reduced MLH1 expression.  Methylation was also detected at the A (64%) and B (74%) regions and intron 1 (56%).

HER2 (Novocastra 10A7): 2+. There is variability in Her 2 staining with some areas of the tumour appearing negative and other foci showing membranous staining. This may reflect fixation artifact. Case sent to Burlington Northern Santa Fe TUMBARUMBA MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE for SISH testing. Please refer to Express Scripts MACKAY report.

Current tumour has been compared to the previous Fine Needle Biopsy (Fortune Brands Pathology 44U44273 (1)) and previous pathology reports (2.23HR STAY SURGICAL UNIT 44-UM-42-7305241 and SEALS Central (44744-27HB)).  The current specimen has the same histological appearances.  The histological and immunohistochemical features are consistent with residual/recurrent high grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.

The reports of the previous biopsies of retroperitoneum are noted (Atmos Energy report 48N67773 and EXMOUTH HOSPITAL Hospital report MV56777326). The core biopsy from KING EDWARD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL has been obtained and reviewed in association with the current resection specimen.

The left submandibular lymph node shows widespread follicular hyperplasia and expansion of germinal centres with prominent tingible body macrophages. Flow cytometry showsa reactive mixed population of T and B lymphocytes. The overall morphology and pattern of immunohistochemical pattern of staining favours a reactive lymphoid (follicular) hyperplasia. However, the presence of extranodal lymphocytic inflammation, as well as, irregular expansion of some of the enlarged hyperplastic follicles is considered atypical. The case will be sent to Dr Bruno (CIT Group) for her expert opinion and a supplementary report will be issued.

The colon, peritoneum and umbilicus show metastatic moderately to well differentiated adenocarcinoma. The morphology of the carcinoma is similar to that previously described in the right axillary and umbilical biopsies(14L01476 eBay YARRA RANGES HEALTH), and would be consistent with metastasis from a primary endometrial tumour.

70 yr old woman with cervix carcinoma.  Had laparoscopic hysterectomy for adenocarcinoma in situ in August 2063 (see Saks Incorporated review).  Final histology showed invasive adenocarcinoma with measurements equating to stage 1B1.  Hysterectomy specimen suggested that cervix incompletely excised.  Today- radical trachelectomy and bilateral pelvic node dissection performed.

BRAF immunohistochemistry was performed and although the tumour shows positive cytoplasmic staining, the control is suboptimal.  A repeat stain is in progress at Pacific Mutual KALGOORLIE, to follow in a supplementary report.

BRAF immunohistochemistry was performed at Computer Sciences Corporation HEALESVILLE.  This stain shows positive cytoplasmic staining in the tumour, however the control is again suboptimal.  This result should be interpreted with caution.
