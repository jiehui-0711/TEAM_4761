Unclassifiable spindle cell sarcoma was the diagnosis made on review by Prof. LOWELL PICCIONI in 2060 for the original pelvic tumour ; a more specific diagnosis was not possible.  The minimal patchy cytoplasmic CD117 staining with background hepatocellular staining in this case, is regarded as a negative result, especially in the context of previous negative DOG1 staining on two separate occasions.

In three of the sections (Blocks A4, A6, A8) there is residual in situ carcinoma identified.  This involves ducts and lobules and is very similar in appearance to the peripheral areas of DCIS present in the previous resection specimen (41K31700).  The features are of DCIS showing pagetoid spread into peripheral ducts and lobules.  The DCIS in the present specimen is intermediate grade and it extends to part of the new inked lateral excision margin.  The appearances are otherwise unremarkable.

The subpleural scar contains a necrotising granuloma and this may represent an old Ghon focus.

426 35行 RANDOLPH HYSMITH-> The left lateral liver lesion consists of a broad area of confluent fibrosis containing variably ectatic to narrowed bile ducts and a moderate to heavy mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate. There is prominent diffuse staining for SMA, and desmin, ALK-1 and cytokeratin stains are negative. The overall histologic features favour hepatolithiasis with an obstructive cholangitis, large duct obstruction within the adjacent liver and a chronic active cholecystitis. However, the differential diagnosis could also include an inflammatory pseudo-tumour; primary inflammatory bile duct disease; and although considered less likely, an infective etiology. Given the broad differential diagnosis, this case will be sent to Professor RANDOLPH HYSMITH at DAYSURGERY UNIT Pathologists, for his expert opinion, and an additional report will be issued.

450 30行 U Plotts-> The morphological appearance of the residual spindle cell component of the current tumour is similar to that described in the consultation review report of the previously excised tumour in which a diagnosis of intermediate grademyofibrosarcoma was favoured (Prof U Plotts, ONCOLOGY (GYNAE) GREAT OCEAN ROAD HEALTH - LORNE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL Hospital; referred from West pathology U65/11882). However, the current tumour displays an additional component of mitotically active pleomorphic epithelioid, spindled and multinucleated tumour cell admixed with osteoclast-like giant cells, not described in the previous excision.  The tumour cells in this focus, as well as a proportion of the purely spindle cell component also display patchy desmin expression, another feature not described in the original excision. There is also patchy SMA expression.  In the context of the previous findings the current tumour appearances are favoured to represent myofibrosarcoma with an evolving higher grade sarcomatous component with admixed osteoclast like giant cells (malignant fibrous histiocytoma-like with osteoclast like giant cells). Given the patchy desmin expression currently and lack of desmin expression in the previously excised tumour, a diagnosis of leiyomyosarcoma with osteoclast like giant cells is regarded as less likely. The FNLCC grade would therefore be 3 (differentiation score=3, mitosis score=3, necrosis score=0; total score =6).

The morphological appearance in association with CD34/desmin positivity is suggestive of a gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), however the characteristic CD117 (c-kit) immunohistochemical stain is negative. Although CD117 negative GISTS are well described, the possibility that the changes represent an alternative diagnosis, such a reactive ?scar-like process, cannot be entirely excluded. The slides will be sent to Professor MONROE PINCKLEY (DUNEDOO MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE Hospital) for his opinion and a supplementary report willbe issued.

file10826 135行 Z Montecillo-> The adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr Z Montecillo who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Stephen comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.

Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus, tubes, ovaries&amp;quot;, specimen received fresh, opened and normal endometrium and tumour taken for study by Dr H Gulston on 18/11/66.  It consists of a uterus with attached cervix and bilateral tubes and ovaries which weighs 88g. No mirena is found. The anterior resection margin is inked blue and posterior inked black. The uterus with attached cervix measures 70 x 40 x 40mm and has a smooth and shiny serosal surface.  On sectioning there is an exophytic lesion extending bilaterally and involving both the anterior and posterior body measuring 38 x 36 x 7mm.  At fundus anterior surface the lesion appears extending into the myometrium to the maximum thickness of 17mm (more than 50% of the myometrium), in a wall 20mm thick. The ectocervix measures 35 x 28mm.  A pale, firm white area noted adjacent to the cervix measuring approximately 12 x 10mm which appears at least 12mm from endometrial lesion.  The right fallopian tube with attached fimbria measures 50mm in length and 10mm in maximum diameter which shows multiple paratubal cysts but is otherwise unremarkable.  The right ovary measures 27 x 17 x 12mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.  The left fallopian tube with attached fimbria measures 50mm in length and 8mm in maximum diameter which has multiple paratubal cysts but is otherwise unremarkable.  The left ovary measures 24 x 20 x 7mm and has an unremarkable cut surface.

There is focal tumour present in subepithelial tissue in these further levels, and this tumour persists in the levels until the tissue is extinguished.  It is therefore considered that there is tumour present very focally at the posterior introital margin.

It is difficult to properly grade the tumour due to minimal amount of neoplastic epithelium (less than 5%).  The presence of extensive fibrosis and numerous macrophages is suggestive of previous neoadjuvant therapy.  If the patient had received neoadjuvant therapy, please refer to previous biopsy for tumour grading.  The most likely primary site is peritoneum.  The right fallopian tube is another possibility.  Clinical correlation is needed.  The case is shown to Dr K Byker and Dr BRYAN HALLIMAN.

file25627 99行 M Arostegui-> The adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr M Arostegui who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Vern comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.

file67643 40行 DYLAN RASHID-> Overall, the 80mm left axillary deposit is a poorly differentiated high grade malignancy. Whilst there are similarities in morphology between the recently reported left axillary biopsy, femoral reaming biopsy and this current left axillary excision, there are some differences in the overall pattern of immunohistochemical staining in the tumours, making definitive classification difficult. However, following intra-departmental review, an overall pathologic differential diagnosis is thought to include: a dedifferentiated malignant melanoma; poorly differentiated carcinoma/neuroendocrine carcinoma; poorly differentiated myoepithelial carcinoma, as well as, a malignant sarcomatoid tumour (eg. MPNST). Given that classification of this tumour is difficult and there remains some uncertainy, the case (and previous biopsies from 2070) will be sent to Professor DYLAN RASHID for an additional opinion.

Inking: black - deep margin, blue - superficial margin, green - deep resection margin, red - superficial false margin, yellow - lateral margin. On sectioning the cut surface shows a pale and multicystic structure with two large cysts up to 80mm in diameter. The cyst wall thickness ranges from 2-5mm. The two larger cysts contain clear serous fluid. The specimen is serially sliced from superior to inferior into eighteen slices. Please see diagrams &amp;amp; photos. Specimen shown to Dr N Lindow.

file7790 135行 M Penrod-> The adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr M Penrod who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Miquel comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.

file9522 135行 W Vaneekelen-> The adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr W Vaneekelen who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Erasmo comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.
