1334 13行 LEONORA HOSPITAL-> Location:  ONCOLOGY (GYNAE)-LEONORA HOSPITAL
1334 34行 NEWMAN HOSPITAL-> The nodule is a minimally invasive well differentiated thyroid carcinoma.  The differential is between a minimally invasive (capsule only) follicular variant of papillary carcinoma and minimally invasive follicular carcinoma, the distinction depending on the interpretation of the nuclear features.  Despite the presence of dense colloid and peripheral scalloping,in my opinion the nuclear features both qualitatively and quantitatively fall short of definite papillary carcinoma and I favour a minimally invasive follicular carcinoma.  Immunohistochemistry is unhelpful in this distinction as boththe tumour cells and background benign follicles stain diffusely with CK19.  Lack of vascular invasion in minimally invasive follicular carcinomas portends a very good prognosis with predicted behaviour akin to a diagnosis of follicularadenoma.  .  There is focal disruption of the surgical margin due to frozen section sampling but in complete full face sections the nodule is 1mm clear with intervening thyroid parenchyma and pseudocapsule.  I will seek a second opinionfrom Prof L Onorati at MEDIC/SURGERY WARD Pathology NEWMAN HOSPITAL Hospital and a supplementary report will be issued.

1811 50行 ESK HOSPITAL-> Received from ESK HOSPITAL Hospital 64 slides comprising 8frozen section H+E sections sublabelled 1 to 4, 28 routine H+E sections sublabelled Al to A14, Bl to B4. Cl to C4, Dl to D3, El to E3, 1 PAS-D stain on A9, and 27 inimunostains with 14 stains on A9, 11 stains on Al3 and 2 stains on D3.  Corresponding paraffin blocks, A9 and A13 are also received along with a copy of Dr Gavalis's report.
1811 61行 NAREMBEEN HOSPITAL-> Additional and repeat immunohistochemistry has been done at NAREMBEEN HOSPITAL. Cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and CAM5.2 show staining of the neuroendocrine component but no staining of the stromal component.  There is also totally negative staining for cytokeratins 5, 7 and 20, high molecular weight cytokeratin 34BE12 and p63. Neuroendocrine markers chromogranin A, synaptophysin and neuron specific enolase are strongly positive in the neuroendocrine component but show no staining of the stromal component.  CD56 at ORROROO CAMPUS is only weakly positive (?different clone of antibody).  There is very weak patchy positivity for S100.  Due to the very primitive nature of the stromal proliferation, germ cell markers were done. Alphafetoprotein, placental alkaline phosphatase and CD30 are negative.  CD117 is negative.  CD99 shows a weak non-specific pattern of staining.  Smooth muscle actin shows positivity in blood vessels only (a less marked reaction than the SOUTHERN YORKE PENINSULA HEALTH SERVICES stain) and desmin is essentially negative although there is some positivity in spindle cells in areas which appear degenerate and ischaemic, a finding that is difficult to interpret.  Mycogen is negative.  CD31and CD34 show a fine vascular network throughout the tumour only.

1811 64行 ROSEBUD HOSPITAL-> Ki-67 estimation using the ROSEBUD HOSPITAL stain is estimated at 22% on the neuroendocrine component.  This is counting a hot spot in block A9 with 153/693 cells being positive. There is no defined standard as to the number of cells counted with recommended numbers varying between 500 and 2000.  The tumour is therefore, technically grade 3, although just so.  It is possible that if a larger number of cells were counted, the count would be below 20%.  The Ki-67 of the stromal component varies considerably averaging about 50% but in some areas getting up to 70-80%.

It seems most likely that the previous diagnosis is correct and that infection was introduced at the biopsy procedure, possibly by breaching the bowel.  The previous biopsy is being sent for FISH testing to look for MDM2 amplification to try and confirm the diagnosis of liposarcoma; a supplementary report will be issued.

450 30行 GREAT OCEAN ROAD HEALTH - LORNE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL-> The morphological appearance of the residual spindle cell component of the current tumour is similar to that described in the consultation review report of the previously excised tumour in which a diagnosis of intermediate grademyofibrosarcoma was favoured (Prof U Plotts, ONCOLOGY (GYNAE) GREAT OCEAN ROAD HEALTH - LORNE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL Hospital; referred from West pathology U65/11882). However, the current tumour displays an additional component of mitotically active pleomorphic epithelioid, spindled and multinucleated tumour cell admixed with osteoclast-like giant cells, not described in the previous excision.  The tumour cells in this focus, as well as a proportion of the purely spindle cell component also display patchy desmin expression, another feature not described in the original excision. There is also patchy SMA expression.  In the context of the previous findings the current tumour appearances are favoured to represent myofibrosarcoma with an evolving higher grade sarcomatous component with admixed osteoclast like giant cells (malignant fibrous histiocytoma-like with osteoclast like giant cells). Given the patchy desmin expression currently and lack of desmin expression in the previously excised tumour, a diagnosis of leiyomyosarcoma with osteoclast like giant cells is regarded as less likely. The FNLCC grade would therefore be 3 (differentiation score=3, mitosis score=3, necrosis score=0; total score =6).
