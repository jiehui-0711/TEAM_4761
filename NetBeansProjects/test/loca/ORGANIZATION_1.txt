213 42行 CIT Group-> The left submandibular lymph node shows widespread follicular hyperplasia and expansion of germinal centres with prominent tingible body macrophages. Flow cytometry showsa reactive mixed population of T and B lymphocytes. The overall morphology and pattern of immunohistochemical pattern of staining favours a reactive lymphoid (follicular) hyperplasia. However, the presence of extranodal lymphocytic inflammation, as well as, irregular expansion of some of the enlarged hyperplastic follicles is considered atypical. The case will be sent to Dr Bruno (CIT Group) for her expert opinion and a supplementary report will be issued.
