426 49行 Australia-> A family history should betaken.  Some patients with hepatolithiasis develop stones because of low levels of MDR3 (ABCB4 mutation). A family history of the following: early cholecystitis (low phospholipid-associated cholecystitis - LPAC - syndrome),jaundice of pregnancy in females, drug induced jaundice and unexplained biliary cirrhosis can be present in patients with inherited MDR3 deficiency.  If the family history is suggestive, ursodeoxycholic acid is of benefit to prevent lithiasis. I am not aware of any Australian centres that provided MDR3 gene analysis".
